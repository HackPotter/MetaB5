# MetaBlast in Unity 5.6
___
*MetaBlast is a 3D Educational action-adventure game that puts you in the pilot's seat. Shrink down to microscopic size and explore the vivid, dynamic world of a soybean plant cell. The eukaryotic cell is comprised of a dizzying array of molecules, proteins, and organelles. To understand the nature of these entities and their processes across both time and space can be a daunting task. The goal of MetaBlast is to provide a medium that lends itself to the comprehension of cell and metabolic biology. Of course, building and populating an accurate 3D representation of a plant cell is no trivial undertaking, which is why the MetaBlast team spans numerous disciplines. Faculty and students in biology, art, computer science, music, and game design are all equally important in the construction of a compelling and accurate virtual cell game.*

[MetaBlast](https://www.MetaBlast.org) is created and maintained at [Iowa State University](https://www.iastate.edu) using the [Unity Game Development Engine](https://www.unity3d.com).
